EACirc is a framework for automatic problem solving. It can be utilized as randomness testing tool similar to statistical bateries (NIST STS, Dieaharder, TestU01), for instance for analysis of cryptografical function outputs.

It uses supervised learning techniques based on metaheuristics to construct adapted distinguisher of two input data streams. The distinguisher can be represented as harware-like circuits or algebraic polynomial. 

## The Framework

This repository contains EACirc core and code for data stream generaion (mainly eSTREAM and SHA-3 candidates).
Further tools are:
* [Randomness Testing Toolkit (RTT)](https://github.com/crocs-muni/randomness-testing-toolkit),
* [tools for GRID computations](https://github.com/crocs-muni/eacirc-utils)
* [Oneclick](https://github.com/crocs-muni/oneclick) a tool for BOINC computation (deprecated)

For more information and details see [project wiki pages](http://github.com/petrs/EACirc/wiki/Home).

## Authors
The framework is developed at the [Centre for Research on Cryptography and Security (formerly Laboratory of Security and Applied Cryptography)](https://www.fi.muni.cz/research/crocs/), [Masaryk University](http://www.muni.cz/), Brno, Czech Republic.
